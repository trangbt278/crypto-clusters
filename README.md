# Cryptocurrency Clusters

## Background

*A prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. Theyâ€™ve asked a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and determine whether they can be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

* With raw data, first need to process it to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known classification system, unsupervised learning wii be used. Several clustering algorithms will be used to explore whether the cryptocurrencies can be grouped together with other similar cryptocurrencies and use data visualization to share your findings with the investment bank.
